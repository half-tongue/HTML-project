            <h2>A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p> I was born in a city called Maracaibo, located in the northwestern region of Venezuela. I stayed there for about a year, after 
                which I moved here, to Calgary, and have been here ever since! I currently am living at home with my loving parents and my younger 
                sister. Most of my days are spent at SAIT, as I am currently in my first semester of the Interactive Design program at SAIT, although 
                I foresee choosing a different path for my future. On my free time, you are most likely to catch me slamming back some yummy food, 
                watching movies, or cranking some tunes!!!</p>
            <h3>Favorite foods</h3>

                <p>Food is something very special to me. It is extremely restorative, humbling, and I am often times sharing the experience with those 
                close to me. Below is a chart of my tried and true food and drinks, as well as the perfect scenario to enjoy these meals.

                <p>My #1 rapper has got to be <a href="https://www.travisscott.com/">Travis Scott</a>. I have most of his albums on vinyl (multiple copies 
                for one of them), plenty of merch, and plan to attend multiple shows of his in the future. My favorite song by him would have to be 
                impossible, off of Rodeo. My dream is to let loose and rage in a moshpit at one of his performances.</p>

            <h2>MY WORK</h2>
                <h3>Career goals</h3>
                <p>I have always envisioned myself creating all kinds of artistic content across a multitude of media. My main area of interest lies withtin 
                creating music, but I will definitely end up creating things like videos, websites, grafitti, and illustrations to name a few. I don't 
                currently have to much practical experience that these works require, but I am eager to learn! My ultimate goal would be to create a group of 
                like-minded individuals who create globally-recognized work.</p>
